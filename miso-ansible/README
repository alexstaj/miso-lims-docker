To run this demo you will need to install:
Vagrant - https://www.vagrantup.com/
Ansible - https://www.ansible.com/

The ansible web site tries to sell you on installing from source. I don't
recommend this since it's not as easy as they claim. Try to find a package
for your system.



It testing Ansible against a Vagrant machine.

Install and turn on Vagrant machine.
$ vagrant up
When done, turn it off.
$ vagrant halt
Poke around inside the machine.
$ vagrant ssh
Vagrant machine ports forwarded to host machine:
8090 - tomcat/miso port
3307 - mysql port


To run ansible use the command:
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts --private-key=.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key -u vagrant miso.yml
